          Why is it important to study women composers, especially women
          composers of color?
        </h3>
        <p>
          It is important to study these composers because the vast majority of
          the musical canon and those who we study are white men from Europe.
          While there is plenty of good to study from those composers, we are
          missing out on a PLETHORA of music from composers who had different
          viewpoints, different styles, and different motivations. By bringing
          these composers into our classrooms, we can show just how wide the
          canon really is and bring role models to people who are not just white
          dudes.

          Use the following drop-down menu to select which composer you'd like
          to learn more about. There are six different options, each of which is
          an woman composer of color. There is one active composer to choose
          from and she has an "(active)" label next to her name. Please enjoy
          and I hope you learn something!

          *Please note that not every composer's two pieces were available to
          listen online. I've attached links to those that were.*
